# object that implements the `AsyncComputer` interface. When the model chooses
# a computer action, the Agents SDK calls methods on this object such as
# `screenshot`, `click`, `type`, `scroll` and `keypress`.
#
# Playwright is just the implementation detail we use here. It gives us a
# controllable Chromium browser without moving the real OS mouse or typing into
# whatever app the presenter is using.

# ComputerTool key names are model-facing names, such as "ctrl" and "enter".
# Playwright expects browser-driver names, such as "Control" and "Enter".
# This map translates the common key names the model may request.
